# touchidcheck

### What

It checks to see if the machine it is running on has a TouchID sensor.

### How

Check it out and run `xcodebuild`. (Or download [the binary release][2] and run that).

### Why

I wanted to be able to know whether to automatically install [pam\_touchid][1] while setting up my machines.
